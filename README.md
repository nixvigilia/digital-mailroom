# Digital Mailroom Service

A modern Digital Mailroom platform designed to **digitize incoming physical mail and make it accessible online**. This project provides an easy way to receive, view, and manage mail digitally without relying solely on traditional paper processes.

## Overview

Physical mail creates friction. It piles up, gets lost, and requires someone to be on site to open, scan, sort, or forward it. This project brings the entire mail-handling process online by digitizing every piece of incoming physical mail.

With this service, users can:

- Receive their postal mail at a dedicated address
- Have envelopes scanned and uploaded automatically
- Request full document scans on demand
- Access, search, and organize everything through a secure online dashboard
- Forward or shred physical mail as needed

The goal is to eliminate delays, reduce manual work, and support remote-first workflows.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

- **Mail stuck in one location** — You can access it anywhere.
- **Slow manual handling** — Scanning and routing become automated.
- **Lost or misrouted mail** — Each piece is digitally tracked.
- **Paper can't integrate with systems** — Digital files can.

In short: **It brings paper mail online.**
